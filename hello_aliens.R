cat("To whom it may concern,
    My name is Ata Numanbayraktaroglu, and I am from the planet Earth, 
    located in the Milky-way galaxy, and the third planet away from the
    Sun. We mean no harm. Our planet is the only known planet to hold 
    any sign of life in the observable spectrum from our perspective so 
    we are unable to determine if this message will reach anyone. We
    consider ourselves intelligent to the point that we are able to
    venture off to other planets using drones and gather information on 
    them. I am using a language named English, which is a very popular
    language in our planet. My apologies if you do not understand. Our 
    world is split into countries, each with their government and 
    culture. Much like the dream many people around Earth have of 
    travelling to many countries, we wish to travel to other planets and
    possibly galaxies in the future. We do not seek to invade nor 
    terrorize other planets, but simply visit and gather information. 
    If you wish to make further contact, which we hope you do, please 
    send a radio wave back to us and we will establish a more efficient 
    means of communications from there. 
    
    Thank you very much, 
    Best regards, 	
    Ata Numanbayraktaroglu"
